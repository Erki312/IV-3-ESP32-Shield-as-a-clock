# IV-3-ESP32-Shield-as-a-clock
Modernized version of the Elektor clock from 2015. The original Arduino controller has been replaced by an ESP32-S3 board in Arduino form factor. The clock now syncs its time via NTP and can be fully configured through an integrated web interface (Wi-Fi settings, time settings, etc.) without modifying the original clock hardware.
